Stores raw data as received from source systems (CRM, ERP) without modifications. Data is ingested from CSV files into the SQL Server Database for initial storage.

### ⚪ Silver Layer: 
Performs data cleansing, standardization, and normalization to enhance data quality and prepare it for analysis. This ensures consistency and usability across different datasets.

### 🟡 Gold Layer: 
Contains business-ready data, structured using a star schema for efficient reporting and analytics. Optimized views and aggregate tables enable seamless BI, reporting, and machine learning applications. 🚀
